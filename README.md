### Waiting lists data simulation

This project generates a simulated waiting lists dataset, created in the WL_sim_script.R file. This file is automatically run when the analysis script is run (01x_analysis_script_redo.R), and also loads any required packages. 

01x_analysis_script_redo.R demonstrates a proposed methodology for assessing the effects of waiting for various different periods of time to receive a procedure vs waiting for a target time through difference-in-difference comparisons.
